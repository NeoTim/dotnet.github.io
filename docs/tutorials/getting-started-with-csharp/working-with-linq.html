              <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
              
<p>This tutorial teaches you a number of features in .NET Core and the C# language. You’ll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to generate sequences with LINQ</li>
<li>How to write methods that can be easily used in LINQ queries.</li>
<li>How to distinguish between eager and lazy evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<p>You&#39;ll learn these techniques by building an application that demonstrates
one of the basic skills of any magician: the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faro_shuffle">faro shuffle</a>. Briefly,
a faro shuffle is a technique where you split a card deck exactly in half,
then the shuffle interleaves each one card from each half to rebuild the
original deck.</p>
<p>Magicians use this technique because every card is in a known location
after each shuffle, and the order is a repeating pattern. </p>
<p>For our purposes, it is a light hearted look at manipulating sequences
of data. The application you&#39;ll build will construct a card deck, and
then perform a sequence of shuffles, writing the sequence out each time.
You&#39;ll also compare the updated order to the original order.</p>
<p>This tutorial has multiple steps. After each step, you can run the
application and see the progress.</p>
<h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>
<p>You’ll need to setup your machine to run .NET core. Instructions are
<a href="http://dotnet.github.io/getting-started/">here</a>. You can run this
application on Windows, Ubuntu Linux, OS X or in a Docker container. 
You’ll need to install your favorite code editor. The descriptions below
use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> which is an open
source, cross platform editor. However, you can use whatever tools you are
comfortable with.</p>
<h1 id="create-the-application">Create the Application</h1>
<p>The first step is to create a new application. Open a command prompt and
create a new directory for your application. Make that the current
directory. Type the command &quot;dotnet new&quot; at the command prompt. This
creates the starter files for a basic “Hello World” application.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve never used C# before, <a href="console-teleprompter.html">this tutorial</a>
explains the structure of a C# program. You can read that and then
return here to learn more about LINQ. </p>
<h1 id="creating-the-data-set">Creating the Data Set</h1>
<p>Let&#39;s start by creating a deck of cards. You&#39;ll do this using a LINQ
query that has two sources (one for the four suits, one for the
thirteen values). You&#39;ll combine those source into a 52 card deck.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the query:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">var startingDeck = from s in Suits()
                   from r in Ranks()
                   select new { Suit = s, Rank = r };
</code></pre>
<p>The multiple <code>from</code> clauses produce a <code>SelectMany</code>, which creates
a single sequence from combining each element in the first sequence
with each element in the second sequence. The order is important
for our purposes. The first element in the first source sequence
(Suits) is combined with every element in the second sequence (Values).
This produces all thirteen cards of first suit. That process is repeated
with each element in the first sequence (Suits). The end result is a deck of cards
ordered by suits, followed by values.</p>
<p>Next, you&#39;ll need to build the Suits() and Ranks() methods. Let&#39;s start
with a really simple set of <em>iterator methods</em> that generate the sequence
as an enumerable of strings:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">static IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Suits()
{
    yield return &quot;clubs&quot;;
    yield return &quot;diamonds&quot;;
    yield return &quot;hearts&quot;;
    yield return &quot;spades&quot;;
}

static IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Ranks()
{
    yield return &quot;two&quot;;
    yield return &quot;three&quot;;
    yield return &quot;four&quot;;
    yield return &quot;five&quot;;
    yield return &quot;six&quot;;
    yield return &quot;seven&quot;;
    yield return &quot;eight&quot;;
    yield return &quot;nine&quot;;
    yield return &quot;ten&quot;;
    yield return &quot;jack&quot;;
    yield return &quot;queen&quot;;
    yield return &quot;king&quot;;
    yield return &quot;ace&quot;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>These two methods both utilize the <code>yield return</code> syntax to produce a sequence
as they run. The compiler builds an object that implements <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>
and generates the sequence of strings as they are requested.</p>
<p>Go ahead and run the sample you&#39;ve built at this point. It will display
all 52 cards in the deck. You may find it very helpful to run this sample
under a debugger to observe how the <code>Suits()</code> and <code>Values()</code> methods
execute. You can clearly see that each string in each sequence is generated
only as it is needed.</p>
<h1 id="manipulating-the-order">Manipulating the Order</h1>
<p>Next, let&#39;s build a utility method that can perform the shuffle. The first step
is to split the deck in two. The <code>Take()</code> and <code>Skip()</code> methods that are
part of the LINQ APIs provide that feature for us:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">var top = startingDeck.Take(26);
var bottom = startingDeck.Skip(26);
</code></pre>
<p>The shuffle method doesn&#39;t exist in the standard library, so you&#39;ll have
to write your own. This new method illustrates several techniques that you&#39;ll
use with LINQ-based programs, so let&#39;s explain each part of the method in
steps.</p>
<p>The signature for the method creates an <em>extension method</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">public static IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; InterleaveSequenceWith&lt;T&gt;
    (this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; first, IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; second)
</code></pre>
<p>An extension method is a special purpose <em>static method.</em>
You can see the addition of the <code>this</code> modifier on the first
argument to the method. That means you call the method as though
it were a member method of the type of the first argument.</p>
<p>Extension methods can be declared only inside <code>static</code> classes, so
let&#39;s create a new static class called <code>extensions</code> for this functionality.
You&#39;ll add more extension methods as you continue this tutorial, and those
will be placed in the same class.</p>
<p>This method declaration also follows a standard idiom where the input and
output types are <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>. That practice enables LINQ methods to
be chained together to perform more complex queries.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace LinqFaroShuffle
{
    public static class Extensions
    {
        public static IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; InterleaveSequenceWith&lt;T&gt;
            (this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; first, IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; second)
        {
            // implementation coming.
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>You will be enumerating both sequences at once, interleaving the elements,
and creating one object.  Writing a LINQ method that works with two
sequences requires that you understand how <code>IEnumerable</code> works.</p>
<p>The <code>IEnumerable</code> interface has one method: <code>GetEnumerator()</code>. The object
returned by <code>GetEnumerator()</code> has a method to move to the next element,
and a property that retrieves the current element in the sequence. You
will use those two members to enumerate the collection and return the
elements. This Interleave method will be an iterator method, so instead
of building a collection and returning the collection, you&#39;ll use the 
<code>yield return</code> syntax shown above. </p>
<p>Here&#39;s the implementation of that method:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">public static IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; InterleaveSequenceWith&lt;T&gt;
    (this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; first, IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; second)
{
    var firstIter = first.GetEnumerator();
    var secondIter = second.GetEnumerator();
    while (firstIter.MoveNext() &amp;&amp; secondIter.MoveNext())
    {
        yield return firstIter.Current;
        yield return secondIter.Current;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now that you&#39;ve written this method, go back to the <code>Main</code> method
and shuffle the deck once:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var startingDeck = from s in Suits()
                       from r in Ranks()
                       select new { Suit = s, Rank = r };
    foreach (var c in startingDeck)
        Console.WriteLine(c);

    var top = startingDeck.Take(26);
    var bottom = startingDeck.Skip(26);

    var shuffle = top.InterleaveSequenceWith(bottom);
    foreach (var c in shuffle)
        Console.WriteLine(c);
}
</code></pre>
<h1 id="comparisons">Comparisons</h1>
<p>Let&#39;s see how many shuffles it takes to set the deck back to its
original order. You&#39;ll need to write a method that determines if
two sequences are equal. After you have that method, you&#39;ll need to
place the code that shuffles the deck in a loop, and check to see when
the deck is back in order.</p>
<p>Writing a method to determine if the two sequences are equal should
be straightforward. It&#39;s a similar structure to the method you wrote
to shuffle the deck. Only this time, instead of yield returning each
element, you&#39;ll compare the matching elements of each sequence. When
the entire sequence has been enumerated, if every element matches,
the sequences are the same:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">public static bool SequenceEquals&lt;T&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; first, IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; second)
{
    var firstIter = first.GetEnumerator();
    var secondIter = second.GetEnumerator();
    while (firstIter.MoveNext() &amp;&amp; secondIter.MoveNext())
    {
        if (!firstIter.Current.Equals(secondIter.Current))
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This shows a second Linq idiom: terminal methods. They take a sequence as input
(or in this case, two sequences), and return a single scalar value. These methods,
when they are used, are always the final method of a query. (Hence the name). </p>
<p>You can see this in action when you use it to determine when the deck
is back in its original order. Put the shuffle code inside a loop, and stop when
the sequence is back in its orginal order by applying the <code>SequenceEquals()</code>
method. You can see it would always be the final method in any query, because it
returns a single value instead of a sequence:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">var times = 0;
var shuffle = startingDeck;
do
{
    shuffle = shuffle.Take(26).InterleaveSequenceWith(shuffle.Skip(26));

    foreach (var c in shuffle)
        Console.WriteLine(c);

    Console.WriteLine();
    times++;
} while (!startingDeck.SequenceEquals(shuffle));
Console.WriteLine(times);
</code></pre>
<p>Run the sample, and see how the deck rearranges on each shuffle, until
it returns to its original configuration after 8 iterations.</p>
<h1 id="optimizations">Optimizations</h1>
<p>The sample you&#39;ve built so far executes an <em>in shuffle</em>, where the
top and bottom cards stay the same on each run. Let&#39;s make one change,
and run an <em>out shuffle</em>, where all 52 cards change position. For an out shuffle,
you interleave the deck so that the first card in the bottom half becomes the
first card in the deck. That means the last card in the top half becomes the bottom
card. That&#39;s just a one line change. Update the call to shuffle to change the order
of the top and bottom halves of the deck:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">shuffle = shuffle.Skip(26).InterleaveSequenceWith(shuffle.Take(26));
</code></pre>
<p>Run the program again, and you&#39;ll see that it takes 52 iterations for the
deck to reorder itself. You&#39;ll also start to notice some serious performance degradations
as the program continues to run.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for this. Let&#39;s tackle one of the major causes: inefficient
use of <em>lazy evaluation</em>.</p>
<p>LINQ queries are evaluated lazily. The sequences are generated only as the elements are requested.
Usually, that&#39;s a major benefit of LINQ. However, in a use such as this program, this causes
exponential growth in execution time.</p>
<p>The original deck was generated using a LINQ query. Each shuffle is generated by performing three
LINQ queries on the previous deck. All these are performed lazily. That also means they are performed
again each time the sequence is requested. By the time you get to the 52nd iteration, you&#39;re regenerating
the original deck many, many times. Let&#39;s write a log to demonstrate this behavior. Then, you&#39;ll fix it.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a log method that can be appended to any query to mark that the query executed.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">public static IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; LogQuery&lt;T&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; sequence, string tag)
{
    using (var writer = File.AppendText(&quot;debug.log&quot;))
    {
        writer.WriteLine($&quot;Executing Query {tag}&quot;);
    }
    return sequence;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next, instrument the definition of each query with a log message:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">public static void Main(string[] args)
{
var startingDeck = (from s in Suits().LogQuery(&quot;Suit Generation&quot;)
                    from r in Ranks().LogQuery(&quot;Rank Generation&quot;)
                    select new { Suit = s, Rank = r }).LogQuery(&quot;Starting Deck&quot;);
    foreach (var c in startingDeck)
        Console.WriteLine(c);

    Console.WriteLine();
    var times = 0;
    var shuffle = startingDeck;
    do
    {
        //shuffle = shuffle.Take(26).LogQuery(&quot;Top Half&quot;)
        //    .InterleaveSequenceWith(shuffle.Skip(26).LogQuery(&quot;Bottom Half&quot;)).LogQuery(&quot;Shuffle&quot;);

        shuffle = shuffle.Skip(26).LogQuery(&quot;Bottom Half&quot;)
            .InterleaveSequenceWith(shuffle.Take(26).LogQuery(&quot;Top Half&quot;)).LogQuery(&quot;Shuffle&quot;);

        foreach (var c in shuffle)
            Console.WriteLine(c);
        times++;
        Console.WriteLine(times);
    } while (!startingDeck.SequenceEquals(shuffle));
    Console.WriteLine(times);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that you don&#39;t log every time you access a query. You log only when you create
the original query. The program still takes a long time to run, but now you can see why.
If you run out of patience running the outer shuffle with logging turned on, switch back
to the inner shuffle. You&#39;ll still see the lazy evaluation effects. In one run, it executes
2592 queries, including all the value and suit generation.</p>
<p>There is an easy way to update this program to avoid all those executions. There are 
LINQ methods <code>ToArray()</code> and <code>ToList()</code> that cause the query to run, and store the results
in an array or a list, respectively. You use these methods to cache the data results of a query
rather than execute the source query again.  Append the queries that generate the card decks
with a call to <code>ToArray()</code> and run the query again:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">public static void Main(string[] args)
{
var startingDeck = (from s in Suits().LogQuery(&quot;Suit Generation&quot;)
                    from v in Ranks().LogQuery(&quot;Rank Generation&quot;)
                    select new { Suit = s, Rank = r })
                    .LogQuery(&quot;Starting Deck&quot;)
                    .ToArray();
    foreach (var c in startingDeck)
        Console.WriteLine(c);

    Console.WriteLine();
    var times = 0;
    var shuffle = startingDeck;
    do
    {
        shuffle = shuffle.Take(26).LogQuery(&quot;Top Half&quot;)
            .InterleaveSequenceWith(shuffle.Skip(26).LogQuery(&quot;Bottom Half&quot;)).LogQuery(&quot;Shuffle&quot;).ToArray();

        //shuffle = shuffle.Skip(26).LogQuery(&quot;Bottom Half&quot;)
        //    .InterleaveSequenceWith(shuffle.Take(26).LogQuery(&quot;Top Half&quot;)).LogQuery(&quot;Shuffle&quot;);

        foreach (var c in shuffle)
            Console.WriteLine(c);
        times++;
        Console.WriteLine(times);
    } while (!startingDeck.SequenceEquals(shuffle));
    Console.WriteLine(times);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Run again, and the inner shuffle is down to 30 queries. Run again with the outer shuffle
and you&#39;ll see similar improvements. (It now executes 162 queries).</p>
<p>Don&#39;t misinterpret this example by thinking that all queries should run
eagerly. This example is desgined to highlight the use cases where lazy
evaluation can cause performance difficulties. That&#39;s because each new
arrangement of the deck of cards is built from the previous arrangement.
Using lazy evaluation means each new deck configuration is built from
the original deck, even executing the code that built the <code>startingDeck</code>.
That causes a large amount of extra work. </p>
<p>In practice, some algorithms run much better using eager evaluation, and others run much
better using lazy evaluation. (In general, lazy evaluation is a much better choice
when the data source is a separate process, like a database engine. In those cases,
lazy evaluation enables more complex queries to execute only one round trip to the
database process.) LINQ enables both lazy and eager evaluation. Measure, and pick
the best choice.</p>
<h1 id="preparing-for-new-features">Preparing for New Features</h1>
<p>The code you&#39;ve written for this sample is an example of creating a simple prototype that does the
job. This is a great way to explore a problem space, and for many features, it may be
the best permanent solution. You&#39;ve leveraged <em>anonymous types</em> for the cards, and each
card is represented by strings.</p>
<p><em>Anonymous Types</em> have many productivity advantages. You don&#39;t need to define a class yourself
to represent the storage. The compiler generates the type for you. The compiler genreated type
utilizes many of the best practices for simple data objects. It&#39;s <em>immutable</em>, meaning that
none of its properties can be changed after it has been constructed. Anonymous types are
internal to an assembly, so they aren&#39;t seen as part of the public API for that assembly.
Anonymous types also contain an override of the <code>ToString()</code> method that returns a formatted
string with each of the values.</p>
<p>Anonymous types also have disadvantages. They don&#39;t have accessible names, so you can&#39;t use
them as return values or arguments. You&#39;ll notice that any methods above that used these anonymous
types are generic methods. The override of <code>ToString()</code> may not be what you want as the application
grows more features. </p>
<p>The sample also uses strings for the suit and the rank of each card. That&#39;s quite open ended.
The C# type system can help us make better code, by leveraging <code>enum</code> types for those
values.</p>
<p>Start with the suits. This is a perfect time to use an <code>enum</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">public enum Suit
{
    Clubs,
    Diamonds,
    Hearts,
    Spades
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Suits()</code> method also changes type and implementation:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">static IEnumerable&lt;Suit&gt; Suits()
{
    yield return Suit.Clubs;
    yield return Suit.Diamonds;
    yield return Suit.Hearts;
    yield return Suit.Spades;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next, do the same change with the Rank of the cards:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">public enum Rank
{
    Two,
    Three,
    Four,
    Five,
    Six,
    Seven,
    Eight,
    Nine,
    Ten,
    Jack,
    Queen,
    King,
    Ace
}
</code></pre>
<p>And the method that generates them:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">static IEnumerable&lt;Rank&gt; Values()
{
    yield return Rank.Two;
    yield return Rank.Three;
    yield return Rank.Four;
    yield return Rank.Five;
    yield return Rank.Six;
    yield return Rank.Seven;
    yield return Rank.Eight;
    yield return Rank.Nine;
    yield return Rank.Ten;
    yield return Rank.Jack;
    yield return Rank.Queen;
    yield return Rank.King;
    yield return Rank.Ace;
}
</code></pre>
<p>As one final cleanup, let&#39;s make a type to represent the card, instead of 
relying on an anonymous type. Anonymous types are great for lightweight,
local types, but in this example, the playing card is one of the main
concepts. It should be a concrete type.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">public class PlayingCard
{
    public Suit CardSuit { get; }
    public Rank CardRank { get; }

    public PlayingCard(Suit s, Rank r)
    {
        CardSuit = s;
        CardRank = r;
    }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $&quot;{CardRank} of {CardSuit}&quot;;
    }

<p>This type uses <em>auto-implemented read-only properties</em> which are set
in the constructor, and then cannot be modified. It also makes use of
the new <em>string interpolation</em> feature that makes it easier to format
string output.</p>
<p>Update the query that generates the starting deck to use the new type:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">var startingDeck = (from s in Suits().LogQuery(&quot;Suit Generation&quot;)
                    from r in Ranks().LogQuery(&quot;Value Generation&quot;)
                    select new PlayingCard(s, r))
                    .LogQuery(&quot;Starting Deck&quot;)
                    .ToArray();
</code></pre>
<p>Compile and run again. The output is a little cleaner, and the code is a bit
more clear and can be extended more easily.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This sample should you some of the methods used in LINQ, how to create your
own methods that will be easily used with LINQ enabled code. It also showed
you the differences between lazy and eager evaluation, and the affect that
decision can have on performance.</p>
<p>And, you learned a bit about one magician&#39;s technique. Magician&#39;s use the
faro shuffle because they can control where every card moves in the deck.
In some tricks, the magician has an audience member place a card on top
of the deck, and shuffles a few times, knowing where that card goes. Other
illusions require the deck set a certain way. A magician will set the deck
prioring to performing the trick. Then she will shuffle the deck 5 times
using an inner shuffle. On stage, she can show what looks like a random
deck, shuffle it 3 more times, and have the deck set exactly how she wants.</p>
