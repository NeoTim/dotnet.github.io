              <h1 id="overview-of-net-implementations">Overview of .NET implementations</h1>
              
<p>.NET Platform is, at its very core, a set of standards that can be implemented. There are various implementations, some coming from Microsoft, some coming from other companies and groups.</p>
<h2 id="-net-core">.NET Core</h2>
<p>.NET Core is a cloud-optimized, cross-platform implementation of the .NET Platform. It currently supports three main operating systems: Linux, Windows and OS X.</p>
<p>There are several characteristics of .NET Core:</p>
<p><strong>Cross-platform support</strong> is the first important feature. For applications, it is important to use those platforms that will provide the best environment for their execution. Thus, having an application platform that can enable the app to be ran on different operating systems with minimal or no changes provides a significant boon.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source</strong> because it is proven to be a great way to enable a larger set of platforms, supported by community contribution.</p>
<p><strong>Better packaging story</strong> - the framework is distributed as a set of packages that developers can pick and choose from, rather than a single, monolithic platform. .NET Core is the first implementation of .NET Platform that is distributed via <a href="http://www.nuget.org/">NuGet</a> package manager.</p>
<p><strong>Better application isolation</strong> as one of the scenarios for .NET Core is to enable applications to “take” the needed runtime for their execution and deploy it with the application, not depending on shared components on the targeted machine. This plays well with the current trends of developing software and using container technologies like Docker for consolidation.</p>
<h2 id="-net-framework">.NET Framework</h2>
<p>The .NET Framework is the premier implementation of the .NET Platform available for Windows server and client developers. It is a very powerful, very mature framework, with a huge class library (known as the <strong>Framework Class Libraries</strong>) that supports a wide variety of applications and solutions on Windows.</p>
<p>There are additional stacks built on top the .NET Framework that allow developers to build applications ranging from console applications, across rich client (WPF) applications to scalable web applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd30h2yb%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">Windows Forms</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms754130%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)</a> are User Interface (UI) stacks that enable you to build desktop applications for Windows. Windows Forms’ strength is in its rich support for common databinding scenarios as well as access to Windows’ native user interface controls. WPF, on the other hand, allows you to exercise much more control over the look and feel of your application. Both of them allow for building very rich desktop applications that run on Windows, and you should pick the one that is suited for your use case.</p>
<p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms731082%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)</a> is a set of libraries that comprise the middleware services stack on .NET Framework. It allows you to create services that can communicate through various supported protocols using various data formats, and that can be hosted in any process you choose. This leads to one of the major features of WCF: your services are not tied to any particular hosting strategy or approach.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asp.net/">ASP.NET</a> is a web framework. Being a very rich framework, it has several distinct pieces which are used to produce modern and high-performance web applications. <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-forms">ASP.NET Web Forms</a> is a set of tools geared primarily towards developer productivity, allowing quick turnaround on web applications with a drag-and-drop surface reusing web controls for everything from logging in to data binding. <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc">ASP.NET MVC</a> allows for a different approach, one that gives you greater control over the entire pipeline, from the HTTP layer to the user interface. <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api">ASP.NET WebAPI</a> is a convention-based framework for creating REST services. It allows you to set-up a REST endpoint extremely fast. Finally, <a href="http://www.asp.net/signalr">SignalR</a> allows you to provide push-based communication to your web applications using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSocket</a> protocol. Finally, <a href="http://www.asp.net/vnext/">ASP.NET v5</a> is a new version of MVC and WebAPI frameworks that is built to run on top of .NET Core.</p>
<h2 id="-net-native">.NET Native</h2>
<p>.NET Native is not so much an “edition” of the .NET platform as it is a set of tools that allow developers to have different build outputs. The normal .NET source compilation process takes the source code written in one of the .NET languages (such as C#, Visual Basic, F# etc.) and produces something called “Intermediate Language”. IL is then picked up by the runtime, and Just-In-Time compiled at run-time to machine code.</p>
<p>.NET Native is an Ahead-of-Time (AOT) toolchain that compiles IL byte code to native machine code, so that when the code is executed, there is only “native” code running. This means that the resulting binary is what the OS executes; there is no JIT-ing, no runtime compilation. This leads to better performance, as well as some security benefits.</p>
<p>.NET Native is the set of tools used to build .NET <strong>Universal Windows Platform (UWP)</strong> applications.</p>
<h2 id="supported-operating-systems">Supported operating systems</h2>
<p>.NET Core is supported on Windows, Linux and OS X.</p>
<p>.NET Framework is supported on Windows operating system. .NET Native is, at this time, supported on Windows.</p>
